I talked to Hau Phan and Seunghyeon Kim for this assignment. Hau said this assignment reminds her of the mobile app "Replica," which is an AI based app that allows you to have conversations on various topics and is also used for therapy. Seunghyeon mentioned that the key functions for this program would be loops and getting user input. We all tried to come up with a pseudocode; and we all agreed that we will need to use a scanner to get the number of rounds of conversation from the user and user's words that will later be used for making mirrored sentences. We tried to think of a way to mirror the user's unput sentences by changing the pronouns, and one of the options was to use if-else statements. The office hours I attended was 00000000. As this isn't my first time using Java, I wouldn't call this a first impression. But comparing Java with Python, Java looks much more complicated and "wordy." Also, the curly brackets would be the biggest difference from Python. However, although it looks messy, Java is actually much more descriptive, which helps me better understand the code that I'm writing. I went through a lot of struggles and trials when writing the codes for changing pronouns. I first used the if-else statement, but this caused problems when the user's sentence had more than one pronouns (e.g., I am thinking about my cat.).
